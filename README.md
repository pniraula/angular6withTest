# FidelisElevatePlatform

Built with Angular CLI version 6.0.8. All components are inside app/src/alerts. I have had few unit test case scenarios for alerts component in alerts.component.spec.ts


## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
